# Avocado-Price-Forecasting-with-Prophet
This project focuses on forecasting avocado prices using the Facebook Prophet time series model. The dataset contains historical average prices of avocados in the United States. By preprocessing the data and applying Prophet, we can visualize trends, seasonal effects, and make future price predictions for a one-year period.
